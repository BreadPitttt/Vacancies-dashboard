## About
A lightweight dashboard that shows generalâ€‘competition government vacancies for Any Graduate, 12th, and 10th, allowing only typing/computer/physical skills; technical/management/professional degrees are excluded by the scraper rules.  
The site is static (HTML/CSS/JS) and loads data.json generated by a GitHub Actions scraper on a schedule.
