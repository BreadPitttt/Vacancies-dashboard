## About

This dashboard provides a filtered and verified list of government job opportunities suitable for a broad range of applicants. It is designed to be a reliable, up-to-date resource, free from the noise of irrelevant job postings.

The site is a static web page (HTML/CSS/JS) that dynamically loads job listings from a `data.json` file. This file is updated automatically by a resilient Python scraper running on a schedule via GitHub Actions.
