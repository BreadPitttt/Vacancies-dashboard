## About
A lightweight dashboard that shows general‑competition government vacancies for Any Graduate, 12th, and 10th, allowing only typing/computer/physical skills; technical/management/professional degrees are excluded by the scraper rules.  
The site is static (HTML/CSS/JS) and loads data.json generated by a GitHub Actions scraper on a schedule.

## Live site
The dashboard is deployed with GitHub Pages from the main branch via Actions; visit the repository’s Pages URL to view the latest build.

## Features
- Filters for education level, allowed skills, domicile (All India, Bihar), source (official/aggregator), and urgency.  
- “Apply Online” and “View Notification” buttons on each card where links are available.  
- “Applied” and “Not Interested” toggles stored in the browser (localStorage); expired jobs are hidden from the main list and shown only in an Archive if previously marked.  

## Data pipeline
- scraper.py fetches from official issuers (SSC, IBPS, RRBs, BPSC, insurer careers) with aggregator fallbacks; it keeps Any Graduate/12th/10th and allowed‑skills‑only posts, infers or parses last dates, de‑duplicates, and removes expired items.  
- The workflow commits an updated data.json nightly and on manual runs; Pages then republishes the site.  

## Local development
1. Open index.html in a browser (no server required).  
2. Use DevTools → Network with “Disable cache” while iterating on app.js to avoid stale assets.  
3. Edits to data.json update immediately in the UI after a reload.

## File structure
- index.html — containers, filter pills, and a deferred script tag to load app.js.  
- style.css — minimal, accessible styles for cards, chips, badges, and filters.  
- app.js — fetches data.json, renders lists, handles filters, archive, and localStorage.  
- data.json — jobListings array and transparencyInfo metadata written by the workflow.

## Triggering a refresh
- From Actions, select the “Nightly and Monday Recheck” workflow and click “Run workflow” to regenerate data.json on demand.  
- Commits to main also trigger the pages‑build‑deployment workflow that publishes the latest build to the Pages URL.

## Notes
- Badges above auto‑update to reflect the current status of their workflows; regenerate badge Markdown from the Actions UI if branch names change.  
- localStorage persists selections per browser profile; clearing site data resets Applied/Not Interested in that browser profile.
